<h2>About us</h2>

<p>Widow Case's founding members are vocalist / rhythm guitarist Jamie Batchelor and lead-guitarist Daniel Patino. Through a couple of waves of trying new members out unsuccessfully, Jamie and Danny spent a few months reinvisioning the music and their approach. After a few months with just a drum machine and two acoustic guitars, a couple of small shows at the Underground, and a new fire beneath them, they approached Robbie Nelson to join up as drummer and permanent third member.</p>

<p>Robbie was an instant fit. Becoming the third pillar of Widow Case, the band found new life over the early Winter and began writing again with this three-piece. Soon, Robbie's sister Kailyn would become involved as bassist and harmony vocalist. With all members having a voice and their own taste for music, the initial process was to bring all up to speed with the set list. After playing a killer show at Kilby Court for over a hundred, Widow Case was approached by local recording artist Isaac Owens and they began their first EP. This is where we find Widow Case today...</p>
